-- MySQL QUERIES 

SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;


--Thinking process

# process ManagerId shows which Id is both employee and manager
# need to self join
# a.Id | a.Name | a.Salary | a.ManagerId | b.Id | b.Name | b.Salary | b.ManagerId 
# match a.ManagerId = b.Id
# so b.Salary shows salary based on a.ManagerId
# when a.Salary > b.Salary means this employee earns higher than his manager
# select a.Name
